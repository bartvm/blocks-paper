# Paper/report on Blocks and Fuel

I've gotten a few requests from people on how to cite Blocks, so I think it would
be nice to put something on arXiv soon. I'm thinking definitely before the NIPS
deadline (so that means at the start of this week) so that people have something to cite 
before submitting this Friday.

JMLR has [a track](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/mloss/mloss-info.html) for open
source machine learning software that could be interesting to submit to, so
I'm sticking to their guidelines i.e. 4-page limit and template.

Feel free to edit away.

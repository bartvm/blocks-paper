# Paper/report on Blocks and Fuel

I've gotten a few requests from people on how to cite Blocks, so I think it would
be nice to put something on arXiv soon. I'm thinking definitely before the NIPS
deadline so that people have something to cite by then.

JMLR has [a track](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/mloss/mloss-info.html) for open
source machine learning software that could be interesting to submit to as well.
I used their template to make a (very!) rought start this morning.
